# Sequence-Graph-transform

This repository contains python implementation of the algorithm 2 proposed  by Chitta Ranjan, Samaneh Ebrahimi, Kamran Paynabar in their paper[1]



Sequence graph transform feature extraction is a powerful method that extracts the short and long-term sequence features and embeds them in a finite-dimensional feature space.

Thanks to Chitta for having provided test cases https://github.com/cran2367/sgt

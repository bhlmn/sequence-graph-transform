# Sequence-Graph-transform

This repository contains python implementation of the algorithm proposed  by Chitta Ranjan, Samaneh Ebrahimi, Kamran Paynabar



Sequence graph transform feature extraction is a powerful method that extracts the short and long-term sequence features and embeds them in a finite-dimensional feature space.
